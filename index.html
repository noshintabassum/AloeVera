<h2>    How to harvest the plant</h2>

<p>

It’s relatively simple to harvest an aloe plant for gel and juice. You’ll need a mature plant that’s <br> at least a few years old. This ensures a higher concentration of the active ingredients.<br><br>

You’ll also want to wait a few weeks before cutting leaves from the same plant. You may want<br>to have a few plants on rotation if you plan to harvest aloe often.<br><br>

To harvest your aloe plant for gel and juice:<br><br><br>






<ol class="ol">


<li>Remove 3-4 leaves at a time, choosing thick leaves from the outer sections of the plant.<li> 
<li>Ensure the leaves are healthy and free of any mold or damage.<li>
<li>Cut them close to the stem. Most of the beneficial nutrients are found at the base of the  leaves.<li>
<li>Avoid the roots. <li>
<li>Wash and dry the leaves.<li>
<li>Trim the prickly edges with a knife.<li>
<li>Using a knife or your fingers, separate the interior gel from the   outside of the leaf. The interior gel is the part of the aloe that you’ll use.<li>
<li>Allow the yellow sap to drain from the leaf. This is the aloe vera latex. If you plan to use the latex, you can catch this in a container. If you’re not planning to use the latex, you can  dispose of it.<li>
<li>Cut the aloe gel into slices or cubes.<li>


</ol>





If you want smooth aloe gel, after separating the aloe from the exterior  part of the leaf,<br> you can put the aloe into a blender and then strain the  substance to remove the pulp.<br><br><br>.

<a href="  https://www.healthline.com/health/aloe-vera-for-acne ">  
 recipe 
 </a>
 
 
 
 to make a homemade<br> beauty product. It can also be added to food, smoothies, and drinks.<br><br>

 <a href="  https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/aloe-vera-juice-benefits  ">  aloe juice   </a>   , 
 
 
 
 
 use 1 cup of liquid for every 2 tablespoons of aloe gel. Include any other<br> ingredients, like fruit, and use a blender or food processor to mix up your drink.<br><br>

<h2> How to use aloe   </h2>

<p> 
There are plenty of ways you can use aloe vera, both topically and internally.
</p>

<h3> 1. Heals burns   </h3>

<p>

Due to its soothing, moisturizing, and cooling properties, aloe vera is often used to treat burns.<br> <br>

A 

<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23894900/">
2013 study
</a>


Trusted Source with 50 participants found that people who used aloe vera gel to treat<br> superficial and partial thickness burns showed better results than the group that used a 1 <br>percent silver sulfadiazine cream.<br><br>

The aloe vera group showed earlier wound healing and pain relief. Plus, aloe vera had the<br> benefit of being inexpensive.<br><br>

More research is needed, but the available evidenceTrusted Source suggests that aloe gel can be beneficial <br>for burn wound healing.<br><br>

If you have a sunburn or another mild burn, apply aloe vera a few times a day to the area. If you<br> have a severe burn, seek medical help before applying aloe.<br><br>

</p>


<h3> 2. Improves digestive health  </h3>

<p>
Consuming aloe vera may benefit your digestive tract and help to soothe and cure stomach<br> ailments, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).<br><br>

A 2018 review looked at three studies with 151 people. Results from the studies showed that<br> aloe vera significantly improved symptoms of IBS when compared to a placebo. No adverse<br> effects were reported, though more research is needed using a larger study size.<br><br>

Additionally, aloe vera may help inhibit the growth of<i> H. pylori</i> bacteria, which is found in your<br> digestive tract and can lead to ulcers.<br><br>

Keep in mind that this advice is for aloe vera only. Other aloe plants may be poisonous and<br> should not be taken internally.<br><br>


</p>




<h3>3. Promotes oral health </h3>

<p>

Aloe vera toothpaste and mouthwash are natural options for improving oral hygiene and <br>reducing plaque.<br><br>

Results of a 2017 studyTrusted Source found that people who used an aloe vera toothpaste showed<br> significant improvements to their oral health.<br><br>

The study included 40 adolescents who were divided into two groups. Each group used either <br>an aloe vera toothpaste or a traditional toothpaste containing triclosan twice daily.<br><br>

After 30 days, the aloe toothpaste was found to be more effective than the triclosan toothpaste<br> in lowering levels of candida, plaque, and gingivitis.<br><br>

People who used the aloe vera toothpaste showed better overall oral health without<br> experiencing any adverse effects.<br><br>

</p>




<h3>  4. Clears acne</h3>

<p>

Using fresh aloe on your face may help clear up acne. You can also purchase aloe products<br> designed for acne, including cleansers, toners, and creams. These may have the extra benefit<br> of containing other effective ingredients, too.<br><br>

Acne products made with aloe may be less irritating to the skin than traditional acne <br>treatments.<br><br>

A small 2014 study found that a cream combining conventional acne medication with aloe vera <br>gel was significantly more effective than acne medication alone or a placebo in treating mild to<br> moderate acne.<br><br>

In this study, improvements were seen in lower levels of inflammation and fewer lesions in the <br>group who used the combination cream over a period of eight weeks.If you have anal fissures, applying <br>an aloe vera cream to the affected area several times throughout the day may help promote healing.

A 2014<br> studyTrusted Source found that using a cream containing aloe vera juice powder was effective in treating <br>chronic anal fissures. People used the aloe cream three times a day for six weeks.<br><br>



</p>








<h3>5. Relieves anal fissures </h3>

<p>

If you have anal fissures, applying an aloe vera cream to the affected area several times<br> throughout the day may help promote healing.<br><br>

A 2014 studyTrusted Source found that using a cream containing aloe vera juice powder was effective in<br> treating chronic anal fissures. People used the aloe cream three times a day for six weeks.<br><br>

Improvements were shown in pain, hemorrhaging upon defection, and wound healing. These <br>results were significantly different from those of the control group. While this research is<br> promising, further studies are needed to expand upon this research.<br><br>

<p> <a name="Risks">

<h2>  Is aloe vera safe?   </h2>  

<p>

It’s safe for most people to use aloe vera topically for minor skin care concerns. Generally, it’s<br> well tolerated, though skin irritations and allergic reactions are possible. Never use aloe vera or<br> any severe cuts or burns.<br><br>

Pay attention to how your body reacts to aloe. Notice if you experience any sensitivities or<br> adverse reactions. Don’t use aloe if you’re allergic to garlic, onions, or tulips. Avoid taking aloe <br>vera within two weeks of any scheduled surgery.<br><br>

Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and children under the<br> age of 12, should avoid the oral use of aloe vera.<br><br>

Carefully follow the dosage information when taking aloe vera gel or latex internally. Limit your<br> use to small periods of time. After a few weeks of use, take a break for at least one week.<br> Always buy from a reputable brand to ensure safety and quality.<br><br>

The laxative effect of aloe vera latex has the potential to cause diarrhea and abdominal cramps.<br> These effects could inhibit the absorption of oral drugs and reduce their effectiveness.<br><br>

Do not take aloe vera internally if you have the following conditions:<br><br>

<h2> How to care for an aloe vera plant   </h2>

<p>

You can find aloe plants at garden centers, floral shops, and even online. They are usually fairly<br> easy to grow provided they have enough sunlight and warmth.<br><br>

Aloe plants need about six to eight hours of sunlight per day. Younger plants need less direct<br> sunlight than more mature plants. Typically, aloe plants are grown in warmer climates, but they<br> can be grown indoors during colder months.<br><br>

Water your aloe plant when the soil is dry for about two inches below the surface. You can use<br> your finger to determine how dry the soil is.<br><br>

Depending on your climate, you may need to water once a week or even less. Always err on<br> the side of less to avoid overwatering, which can cause the tips of the aloe leaves to brown.<br><br>

Make sure your plant pot has drain holes on the bottom to allow any excess water to run out.<br><br>

Keep your eye on your plant’s health so you can notice any issues that arise and treat them <br>accordingly.<br><br>

<p class ="aloe">

<h2> The takeaway   </h2>
Aloe vera plants are relatively easy to care for and process, and there are many possible uses<br> for the plant.<br><br>

Aloe is generally safe for most people, but if you have an underlying health condition or take<br> medicines or use herbs, talk to your doctor before using aloe as it could react with other<br> medications and substances.<br><br>
